# SOIL
Although you can use the SDL Image library to load images for OpenGL, the Simple OpenGL Image Library (SOIL) is a little easier to use. 

SOIL can read in several file formats, including PNG, BMP, JPG, TGA, and DDS. As itâ€™s designed to work with OpenGL, it slots in easily with the other OpenGL code needed for creating a texture object.

It is based on stb_image version 1.16
